## Detailed Error Analysis

### File 1: OSR_us_000_0010_8k.wav (WER=0.05, 4 errors)

**Transcription Output**:
```
 The birch canoe slid on the smooth
 smooth planks.
 Glue the sheet to the dark blue background.
 It is easy to tell the depth of a well.
 These days a chicken leg is a rare dish.
 rice is often served in round bowls
 The juice of lemons makes fine punch.
 The box was thrown beside the parked truck.
 The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage.
 Four hours of study work faced us.
 A large size in stockings is hard to sell.
```

**Errors**:
1. **"smooth smooth planks"** vs "smooth planks" - Word duplication at sentence boundary
2. **"It is easy"** vs "It's easy" - Contraction expansion
3. **"rice is"** vs "Rice is" - Missing capitalization
4. **"study work"** vs "steady work" - Homophone confusion

### File 2: OSR_us_000_0011_8k.wav (WER=0.0506, 4 errors)

**Transcription Output**:
```
 Okay.
 the boy was there when the sun rose
 A rod is used to catch pink salmon.
 The source of the huge river is the clear spring.
 Kick the ball straight and follow through.
 Help the woman get back to her feet.
 A pot of tea helps to pass the evening.
 The smoky fires lack flame and heat.
 The soft cushion broke the man's fall.
 The salt breeze came across the sea.
 The girl at the booth sold 50 bonds.
```

**Errors** (need to check reference file):
1. **"Okay."** - Extra word at beginning (likely VAD issue)
2. **"the boy"** vs "The boy" - Missing capitalization
3. Possibly other errors (need reference comparison)

### File 3: OSR_us_000_0012_8k.wav (WER=0.0617, 5 errors)

**Transcription Output**:
```
 The small pup gnawed a hole in the sock.
 The fish twisted and turned on the bent hook.
 Press the pants and sew a button on the vest.
 The swan dive was far short of perfect.
 The beauty of the view stunned the young boy.
 Two blue fish swam in the tank.
 Her purse was full of useless trash.
 The colt reared and threw the tall rudder.
 the snowed rain inhaled the same morning
 Read verse out loud for pleasure.
```

**Errors** (need to check reference file):
1. **"the snowed rain inhaled the same morning"** - Multiple errors (likely "It snowed, rained, and hailed the same morning")
2. **"the"** vs "The" - Missing capitalization
3. **"tall rudder"** vs "tall rider" - Homophone confusion

## Error Categories

### 1. Sentence Boundary Issues (2-3 errors)
- **Symptom**: Word duplication at sentence boundaries ("smooth smooth planks")
- **Root Cause**: VAD chunking splits sentences, model repeats last word
- **Solution**: Improve VAD parameters or post-processing to remove duplicates

### 2. Capitalization (3-4 errors)
- **Symptom**: Missing capitalization at sentence starts ("rice is" vs "Rice is", "the boy" vs "The boy")
- **Root Cause**: Model doesn't consistently detect sentence boundaries
- **Solution**: Post-processing to capitalize first word of each sentence

### 3. Contraction Handling (1 error)
- **Symptom**: Expanded forms ("It is" vs "It's")
- **Root Cause**: Model training preference for expanded forms
- **Solution**: Post-processing to normalize contractions

### 4. Homophone Confusion (2-3 errors)
- **Symptom**: Acoustically similar words ("study" vs "steady", "rudder" vs "rider")
- **Root Cause**: Requires semantic context beyond acoustic model
- **Solution**: Language model integration (already present in llama-service)

### 5. Extra Words (1 error)
- **Symptom**: "Okay." at beginning of file 2
- **Root Cause**: VAD pre-roll capturing noise or silence
- **Solution**: Adjust VAD threshold or pre-roll duration

### 6. Severe Transcription Errors (1 error)
- **Symptom**: "the snowed rain inhaled the same morning" (completely wrong)
- **Root Cause**: Possible audio quality issue or model confusion
- **Solution**: Investigate audio file, adjust inference parameters

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Post-Processing (Target: WER < 0.02)
Implement post-processing in whisper-service to fix:
1. Remove duplicate words at sentence boundaries
2. Capitalize first word of each sentence
3. Normalize common contractions ("It is" → "It's")

**Expected Impact**: Fix 6-8 errors → WER ~0.02 (98% accuracy)

### Phase 2: VAD Tuning (Target: WER < 0.01)
Adjust VAD parameters to reduce:
1. Sentence boundary splitting
2. Pre-roll noise capture

**Expected Impact**: Fix 2-3 errors → WER ~0.01 (99% accuracy)

### Phase 3: Model Upgrade (Target: WER = 0)
If post-processing and VAD tuning don't achieve WER=0:
1. Test with full ggml-large-v3.bin (non-turbo)
2. Adjust inference parameters (temperature, beam search)
3. Consider fine-tuning on Harvard corpus

**Expected Impact**: Fix remaining 1-2 errors → WER = 0 (100% accuracy)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify architecture and call_id isolation (COMPLETE)
2. ✅ Run test on first 3 files (COMPLETE)
3. ⏭️ Implement post-processing in whisper-service
4. ⏭️ Re-run test and measure WER improvement
5. ⏭️ Tune VAD parameters if needed
6. ⏭️ Expand to all 25 Harvard files
7. ⏭️ Apply optimizations to inbound-audio-processor.cpp

## Performance Metrics

- **Inference Speed**: ~500ms for 2-3s audio ✅ (real-time or faster)
- **Real-time Factor**: 0.15-0.25 ✅ (4-6x faster than real-time)
- **Throughput**: Can process 4-6 concurrent calls ✅
- **Accuracy**: 94.6% (needs improvement to 100%)

## Conclusion

The architecture is sound and working correctly. The WER of 5.4% is primarily due to:
- Sentence boundary issues (fixable with post-processing)
- Capitalization (fixable with post-processing)
- Contractions (fixable with post-processing)
- Homophones (requires LLM, already in pipeline)

With targeted post-processing, we can achieve WER < 2% (98% accuracy). For WER = 0, we may need VAD tuning or model upgrades.
