**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Status:** Analysis Complete - No Code Changes Made

## Overview

Analyzed research paper "WhisperFlow: speech foundation models in real time" (arXiv:2412.11272v2) and compared with our current Whisper service implementation for real-time telephony.

---

## Key Findings

### What WhisperFlow Solves

WhisperFlow addresses three fundamental inefficiencies in streaming speech processing:

1. **Fixed-length input processing** ‚Üí Variable-length with "hush word"
2. **Redundant decoding** ‚Üí Beam pruning with result reuse
3. **Static resource allocation** ‚Üí Dynamic CPU/GPU pipelining

**Results:** 1.6x-4.7x latency reduction, per-word latency as low as 0.5s, only 7W power on MacBook Air

### Our Current Strengths

‚úÖ **Shared model context** - Model loaded once, reused across all calls  
‚úÖ **Warm-up inference** - GPU kernels pre-compiled, eliminates first-call latency  
‚úÖ **Sessionless design** - Fast call-to-call transitions  
‚úÖ **Metal/MPS acceleration** - Leverages Apple Silicon GPU  
‚úÖ **VAD-based chunking** - Already using variable-length audio chunks

### Our Current Gaps

‚ùå **No beam search** - Using greedy sampling only  
‚ùå **No result reuse** - Each chunk processed independently  
‚ùå **No incremental decoding** - Waits for complete chunk  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Mutex contention** - Shared context protected by single mutex  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Static resource allocation** - GPU used for everything, no dynamic tuning  
‚ö†Ô∏è **No performance metrics** - Latency and throughput not measured

## Conclusion

The WhisperFlow paper presents highly relevant optimizations for our real-time telephony use case. Our current architecture has a solid foundation (shared context, sessionless design, warm-up inference) but lacks advanced decoding optimizations.

**Key Insight:** The biggest potential win is beam pruning with result reuse (1.5x-3x latency reduction), but this requires investigation into whisper.cpp capabilities. Quick wins are available through streaming inference and mutex optimization.

**Recommended Approach:** Start with instrumentation to establish baseline, then implement quick wins (streaming inference, mutex optimization) before tackling more complex optimizations (beam pruning, CPU/GPU pipelining).

**Timeline:** 
- Phase 1 (Instrumentation): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2 (Quick Wins): 1 month
- Phase 3 (Advanced): 2-3 months
- Phase 4 (Model-Level): 4-6 months

**Expected ROI:** Conservative 30-50% latency reduction in Phase 2, potential 1.5x-3x improvement if Phase 3 succeeds.
