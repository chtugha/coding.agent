# Autonomous Testing Summary - Round 1

## Problem Statement
Second call consistently fails with Whisper service not connecting to the inbound audio processor. First call works perfectly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Evidence from User Logs
- **Call 1 (ID: 111)**: ‚úÖ Works perfectly
  - Inbound processor sends REGISTER messages
  - Whisper receives them: "üì• Received REGISTER for call_id 111"
  - Connection established successfully
  
- **Call 2 (ID: 112)**: ‚ùå Fails
  - Inbound processor sends 14 REGISTER messages to UDP 13000
  - SIP client sends 5 additional REGISTER "poke" messages
  - **Whisper NEVER logs receiving any REGISTER messages**
  - No connection established
  - Audio chunks dropped: "‚ö†Ô∏è No Whisper client connected, dropping chunk"

### Key Observation
The failure is NOT in sending (inbound processor logs successful sends), but in **receiving** (Whisper's `recvfrom()` never returns data for call 2).

## Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: TCP Socket Map Cleanup (CRITICAL)
**File**: `whisper-service.cpp` - `destroy_session()` (lines 689-702)

**Problem**: 
- When a call ended, `destroy_session()` closed the TCP socket FD
- BUT it never removed the entry from `call_tcp_sockets_` map
- This caused socket FD leaks and stale map entries

**Fix**:
```cpp
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(tcp_mutex_);
    auto tcp_it = call_tcp_sockets_.find(call_id);
    if (tcp_it != call_tcp_sockets_.end()) {
        int sock = tcp_it->second;
        if (sock >= 0) {
            close(sock);
            std::cout << "üîå Closed TCP socket (FD " << sock << ") for call " << call_id << std::endl;
        }
        call_tcp_sockets_.erase(tcp_it);  // <-- THIS WAS MISSING!
        std::cout << "üßπ Removed call " << call_id << " from TCP sockets map" << std::endl;
    }
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents resource exhaustion and potential blocking of new connections

### Fix #2: Increased UDP Receive Buffer
**File**: `whisper-service.cpp` - `start_registration_listener()` (lines 320-330)

**Problem**: Default UDP receive buffer might be too small, causing packet drops

**Fix**:
```cpp
int rcvbuf = 256 * 1024; // 256KB
if (setsockopt(registration_socket_, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, &rcvbuf, sizeof(rcvbuf)) < 0) {
    std::cerr << "‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to set SO_RCVBUF on registration socket" << std::endl;
} else {
    int actual_rcvbuf = 0;
    socklen_t optlen = sizeof(actual_rcvbuf);
    if (getsockopt(registration_socket_, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, &actual_rcvbuf, &optlen) == 0) {
        std::cout << "üìä UDP receive buffer size: " << actual_rcvbuf << " bytes" << std::endl;
    }
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents packet drops if REGISTER messages arrive faster than they're processed

### Fix #3: Comprehensive Diagnostic Logging
**Files**: `whisper-service.cpp`, `inbound-audio-processor.cpp`

**Added to Whisper service**:
- Message counter to track all received UDP packets
- Loop counter for periodic health checks
- Socket FD tracking in all log messages
- Socket health checks every 100 iterations
- Check for bytes available in UDP buffer (macOS SO_NREAD)
- Enhanced idle heartbeat with FD and running state
- Enhanced error logging with errno values

**Added to Inbound processor**:
- Bytes sent confirmation for each REGISTER message
- Detailed error reporting with errno for send failures

**Impact**: Will immediately reveal where the failure occurs in the next test

## Testing Performed

### Round 1: System Startup and Verification
1. ‚úÖ Cleaned up all existing processes
2. ‚úÖ Started wildfire HTTP server (port 8081)
3. ‚úÖ Started SIP client successfully (PID 66407, port 53110)
4. ‚úÖ Started Whisper service via API (PID 68511)
5. ‚úÖ Started LLaMA service via API (PID 66908)
6. ‚úÖ Started Kokoro service via API (PID 66945)
7. ‚úÖ All services running and healthy

### Limitation
Cannot make actual SIP calls from PBX to test the two-call scenario. The system is ready and waiting for real calls.

## Expected Diagnostic Output on Next Test

### Whisper Startup
```
üìä UDP receive buffer size: 524288 bytes
üì° Whisper registration listener started on UDP port 13000
üì° Whisper registration listener thread started (FD: 6)
```

### First Call (should work as before)
```
üì® UDP message #1 received (12 bytes) from 127.0.0.1:XXXXX
üì• Received REGISTER for call_id 111
üîó Whisper connecting to inbound audio stream: 111 on port 9112
‚úÖ Successfully connected and created session for call 111
```

### First Call End
```
üì§ Received BYE for call_id 111
üîå Closed TCP socket (FD 8) for call 111
üßπ Removed call 111 from TCP sockets map  <-- NEW: Confirms cleanup
üóëÔ∏è Destroyed whisper session for call 111
```

### Second Call - Success Case
```
üì® UDP message #2 received (12 bytes) from 127.0.0.1:XXXXX  <-- Should see this
üì• Received REGISTER for call_id 112
üîó Whisper connecting to inbound audio stream: 112 on port 9113
‚úÖ Successfully connected and created session for call 112
```

### Second Call - Failure Patterns

**Pattern A: UDP packets not received (most likely)**
```
‚è≥ Whisper registration listener idle (5s, FD=6, running=1, waiting on UDP 127.0.0.1:13000)
‚è≥ Whisper registration listener idle (10s, FD=6, running=1, waiting on UDP 127.0.0.1:13000)
```
No "üì® UDP message #2 received" means `recvfrom()` is not returning data

**Pattern B: Socket became invalid**
```
‚ùå Registration socket became invalid (FD: -1), exiting listener
```

**Pattern C: Socket has errors**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Socket error detected (FD=6): <error message>
```

**Pattern D: Buffer overflow**
```
üìä Bytes available in UDP buffer: 262144
```

## Next Steps

### If Second Call Now Works
‚úÖ **Problem solved!** The TCP socket leak was the root cause.

### If Pattern A (packets not received)
Possible causes:
1. OS-level packet filtering or firewall on localhost
2. UDP socket entered a bad state between calls
3. Kernel-level packet drops (check with `netstat -s | grep -i udp`)
4. Race condition in socket operations

**Action**: 
- Check kernel UDP statistics for drops
- Add `strace` to Whisper service to see system calls
- Consider recreating UDP socket between calls

### If Pattern B (socket invalid)
Something is closing the UDP socket between calls.

**Action**:
- Audit all `close()` calls in codebase
- Check for file descriptor reuse bugs
- Add assertion to verify socket FD doesn't change

### If Pattern C (socket errors)
Socket entered error state due to some operation.

**Action**:
- Investigate what operation caused the error
- Check if any code is writing to the UDP socket (should be read-only)

### If Pattern D (buffer overflow)
Listener thread is blocked or not processing fast enough.

**Action**:
- Investigate what's blocking the thread
- Check if any mutex is held too long
- Consider making UDP processing fully non-blocking

## Files Modified

### whisper-service.cpp
- Lines 308-330: Increased UDP receive buffer, added diagnostics
- Lines 359-408: Enhanced registration listener with health checks
- Lines 472-485: Enhanced error logging and idle heartbeat
- Lines 689-702: Fixed TCP socket cleanup in `destroy_session()`

### inbound-audio-processor.cpp
- Lines 389-406: Enhanced REGISTER sending diagnostics

## Build Status
‚úÖ Successfully compiled with no errors or warnings
‚úÖ New binary deployed: `/Users/whisper/Documents/augment-projects/clean-repo/bin/whisper-service`
‚úÖ Service restarted with new binary (PID 68511)

## Confidence Level
**Medium-High** that Fix #1 (TCP socket cleanup) will resolve the issue.

The TCP socket leak could cause:
- File descriptor exhaustion
- Stale entries blocking new connections
- Map lookup failures

If this doesn't fix it, the comprehensive diagnostics will immediately reveal the exact failure point.

## Testing Instructions for User

1. Make first call from PBX ‚Üí should work ‚úÖ
2. Hang up first call
3. Make second call from PBX ‚Üí check if it works
4. Capture logs from:
   - Whisper service output
   - SIP client output (`/tmp/sip-client.log`)
   - Inbound processor output (if separate)
5. Look for the diagnostic patterns described above
6. Report findings

## Autonomous Testing Limitation

Cannot proceed with further rounds without ability to make actual SIP calls from PBX. The system is ready and instrumented for testing, but requires real telephony hardware/software to generate calls.

**Recommendation**: User should test with the current fixes and report results. The enhanced diagnostics will provide clear direction for next steps if the issue persists.

## UDP Socket Verification Tests

Performed manual UDP tests to verify the receiving mechanism:

### Test 1: Single REGISTER
```bash
echo -n "REGISTER:999" | nc -u -w1 127.0.0.1 13000
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```
üì® UDP message #1 received (12 bytes) from 127.0.0.1:53244
üì• Received REGISTER for call_id 999
```

### Test 2: Second REGISTER
```bash
echo -n "REGISTER:888" | nc -u -w1 127.0.0.1 13000
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```
üì® UDP message #2 received (12 bytes) from 127.0.0.1:65092
üì• Received REGISTER for call_id 888
```

### Test 3: BYE Message
```bash
echo -n "BYE:999" | nc -u -w1 127.0.0.1 13000
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```
üì® UDP message #3 received (7 bytes) from 127.0.0.1:61486
üì§ Received BYE for call_id 999
üóëÔ∏è Destroyed whisper session for call 999
```

### Test 4: Full Call Sequence (REGISTER ‚Üí BYE ‚Üí REGISTER)
```bash
echo -n "REGISTER:777" | nc -u -w1 127.0.0.1 13000
echo -n "BYE:777" | nc -u -w1 127.0.0.1 13000
echo -n "REGISTER:666" | nc -u -w1 127.0.0.1 13000
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - All three messages received in order
```
üì® UDP message #4 received (12 bytes) from 127.0.0.1:62179
üì• Received REGISTER for call_id 777
üì® UDP message #5 received (7 bytes) from 127.0.0.1:53464
üì§ Received BYE for call_id 777
üì® UDP message #6 received (12 bytes) from 127.0.0.1:57406
üì• Received REGISTER for call_id 666
```

### Conclusion from UDP Tests

**The UDP receiving mechanism is working perfectly.** Whisper successfully received and processed:
- 6 consecutive UDP messages
- Multiple REGISTER messages
- BYE messages
- Full call sequences (REGISTER ‚Üí BYE ‚Üí REGISTER)

This proves that:
1. ‚úÖ The UDP socket is correctly bound to 127.0.0.1:13000
2. ‚úÖ The `recvfrom()` loop is working correctly
3. ‚úÖ Message parsing is working correctly
4. ‚úÖ The socket remains valid across multiple messages
5. ‚úÖ The BYE ‚Üí REGISTER sequence does not break UDP reception

**Implication**: The issue in the user's scenario must be specific to the real call handling flow, not the UDP mechanism itself. Possible causes:
- Inbound processor not actually sending packets during second call (despite logging)
- Timing issue where Whisper is busy during packet arrival
- Race condition that only occurs with real SIP calls
- Network routing issue specific to the inbound processor's sending

The TCP socket cleanup fix is still critical and may resolve the issue by preventing resource exhaustion.
